# 4-Digit-Display
#This LC-3 assembly language program will have the user increment and decrement a counter. The counter value has a maximum of 9999 and a minimum of 0000. When the counter reaches 9999 #it will wrap around to 0000, and when it reaches 0000 it will wrap around to 9999. The counter value is displayed to the graphics console in 7-segment style digits. The color of the #digits is up to the programmer. The counter can be reset to 0000 by the user and the user can print the value of the counter to the console.
