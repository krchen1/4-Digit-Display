# 4-Digit-Display
This LC-3 assembly language program will have the user increment and decrement a counter. The counter value has a maximum of 9999 and a minimum of 0000. When the counter reaches 9999 it will wrap around to 0000, and when it reaches 0000 it will wrap around to 9999. The counter value is displayed to the graphics console in 7-segment style digits. The color of the digits is up to the programmer. The counter can be reset to 0000 by the user and the user can print the value of the counter to the console.
